# Basic Jeopardy Game!

This project helped me establish using javascript/typescript and applying object oriented programming ideas and concepts!  
I updated it using Vite and Tailwind, but kept the same placeholder questions

_future updates: include database and expand function for creating own games, and player profiles_

Based Off of my Bootcamp repository:
